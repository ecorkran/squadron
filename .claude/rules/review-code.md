### Design Principles

#### SOLID

- **Single Responsibility (SRP):** Each class/module should have one reason to change. If a class handles both business logic and persistence, or both data transformation and presentation, flag it. A good test: can you describe what the class does without using "and"?

- **Open/Closed (OCP):** Code should be open for extension, closed for modification. When adding a new variant requires editing a switch/case or if-else chain in existing code rather than adding a new implementation, that's a violation. Look for: growing conditionals, type-checking dispatches, functions that keep accumulating parameters.

- **Liskov Substitution (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking behavior. Watch for: subclasses that throw NotImplementedError on inherited methods, overrides that silently change return semantics, or isinstance checks that branch on concrete type.

- **Interface Segregation (ISP):** Clients should not depend on methods they don't use. Watch for: large interfaces/protocols where most implementations stub out half the methods, "god objects" that every module imports but each uses a different slice of.

- **Dependency Inversion (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules — both should depend on abstractions. Flag when:
  - A class instantiates its own dependencies (e.g., `self.client = HttpClient()`) instead of accepting them via constructor/parameter
  - Business logic imports concrete infrastructure (database drivers, HTTP clients, file I/O) directly rather than through an interface/protocol
  - Test difficulty is a symptom — if testing requires monkeypatching internals, the dependency graph is inverted

#### Other Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Duplicated logic should be extracted. But note: similar-looking code that changes for different reasons is NOT duplication — premature abstraction is worse than repetition.

- **Composition over Inheritance:** Prefer composing behavior from small, focused objects over deep inheritance hierarchies. Inheritance for code reuse (rather than genuine is-a relationships) creates fragile coupling.

- **Law of Demeter:** Methods should only talk to their immediate collaborators, not reach through chains (`a.b.c.doThing()`). Deep accessor chains indicate missing abstractions.

- **Fail Fast:** Invalid state should be caught at the boundary, not deep in call chains. Validate inputs early, use guard clauses, prefer explicit errors over silent defaults.

- **Failure-Mode Enumeration:** For each new I/O path or message type, the author must be able to answer: "What if this hangs? What if it times out? What if the peer disconnects mid-send?" — explicitly, not implicitly. Each identified failure mode must be *observable* (log at WARNING+ or metric increment), not silent. At least one test should assert the failure mode produces the expected observable signal. Silent failure paths are bugs in waiting.
